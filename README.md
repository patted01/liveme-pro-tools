## Contributors - Branch Name Changed and Other News

The default branch has been changed from **master** to **release-1.x**.  

Work has begun on the **release-2.x** branch.  Most of the code is being rewritten to support IPC calls and smoother methods for data transfer.  I've also switched to using Metro4 UI along with removal of several old libraries.  I've also removed several dependencies on modules thanks to better code writing as well as using different methods for handling local data storage.

*Please see the **release-2.x** branch for more details.*

## Prebuilt Releases (64-bit only!)

To download the latest prebuilt versions, [click here](https://github.com/thecoder75/liveme-pro-tools/releases/latest).

**Current Supported Platforms (64-bit only):**
- Ubuntu-based Linux and Debian Distributions (64-bit)
- macOS v10.11 or higher (64-bit only!)
- Windows 7 or higher (64-bit!)

## 32-bit versions???

We only build 64-bit releases as pretty much all computers now run 64-bit OSes.  

If you need a 32-bit version, you will have to build it yourself.  Unfortunately, we do not offer any support for 32-bit versions.

## FFMPEG No Longer Required?
You can choose to use a basic built-in concat system now to join the chunks downloaded without needing to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.  Or for better support, you can still use FFMPEG settings.

If you wish to transcode the downloads, then you will need to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.
